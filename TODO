do multiple xpath in AND case (only add if already into the previous node set) this should be using the same method as unicity
do last and first as function (like position()  = last())
do operation on function (like last() - 1)
do double predicat (node[3][2])
do select node that as a particular child in conditions : node[childname]
do some functions in xpath syntax (lang, string, number, count...)
do check memory leaks
