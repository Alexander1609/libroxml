The author added an exception to the LGPL v2.1 for static linking: see below.

As a special exception to the LGPL v2.1 (below), the copyright holders of
this library give you permission to statically link this library
with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license
terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting
executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each
linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
module. The resulting executable may therefore be distributed without complying
with the LGPL terms that state that recipients of your executable must be able
to relink against modified versions of the library.

It is also appreciated if you mention in the README or CREDITS the use of
this library.

An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on
this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this exception
to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so.
If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
