The Debian Package libroxml
----------------------------

Why libroxml?
Because XML parsing is always hard to reinvent
Because very often, xml libraries are too big to fit with little application

libroxml allow you to easily:
- load / unload document from files
- load / unload document from buffer
- navigate thru the xml tree using libroxml C/C++ API
- read attributes and attributes' values for nodes
- get text content of nodes
- use XPath expressions
- modify on the loaded XML tree
- create XML from scratch
- applying modification from the loaded XML tree to a file or buffer
